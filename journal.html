for the dog project I really just wanted to show how an div can travel through the website by pressing keys. It could use some work and I will probably fix it in the future.

	We did event listeners and when you pressed one on the square it changed colors. We used event listners and alerts and clicks. We used clicks so much the word click doesnt sound like a real work. We should be adding more to it next time
